## PROJECT PROPOSAL

Before you start writing any code, remember that you only have one week to complete this project. View this project as a typical assignment from work. Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

We will be using data pulled from Kaggle centered around Youtube's top viewed videos. We also made a database of all the regional category names that were joined with the Youtube Data. 


## Finding Data

- EXTRACT: Youtube Video Data was pulled from Kaggle.com
- MERGE: US Category ID data was formatted in a CSV file.

## Data Cleanup & Analysis
